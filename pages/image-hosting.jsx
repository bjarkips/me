        During the design phase, I have chosen an HD image to use as a background. The Netlify CDN is ideal for static site hosting, not so much for large media (it can integrate with Git LFS but I havenâ€™t tried this myself).

        With Cloudinary, I can store my large images and automatically fetch them in the optimal format for each client. Cloudinary stores multiple versions of each image so each transformation is performed only once and cached afterwards.
