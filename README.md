# Welcome to my portfolio

This website is a case study of itself. After reading this, you should have some insight into my workflow and thought process when it comes to making a website.

## 0. Choosing a technology stack

I want to build this website in an efficient manner, therefore I have chosen my personal favourite tools for the job:

- **React.js**. This website should showcase my code patterns and my capabilities in React.
- **Next.js**. Speed is extremely important in increasing engagement on any website. Next.js gives us server-side rendering with minimal setup.
- **Material UI**. As a beginner in design, the Material design scheme gives me rigid guidelines to follow, prioritizing intuitive layouts. Material UI provides basic React components styled according to Material design.
- **Netlify**. A solid hosting option which connects directly to my GitHub repository with minimal setup.
- **Cloudinary**. Loading HD images can be slow and expensive. This image hosting API handles compression, caching, and resizing out of the box.

## 1. Prototyping and design

Proper prototyping and design can save us the trouble of building useless functionality into the webpage, as well as serving as a handy roadmap during development. We should do it properly.
